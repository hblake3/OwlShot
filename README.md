## Project Description
<p>The concept features a top-down view of an owl flying
upwards through a forested environment. Players must navigate by avoiding
branches that emerge on the left and right sides of the screen, using the left and
right arrow keys to steer. Stars will appear in challenging positions, offering point
incentives for players willing to take risks. The game includes a life bar represented
by three hearts, with each collision resulting in the loss of a heart. If all hearts are
depleted, the game will end, prompting a restart. Levels will be structured as preselected
options (Easy and Hard), allowing players to choose their desired difficulty
before starting the game.</p>
